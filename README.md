## Overview

### The challenge
This challenge involved HTML & CSS to create a responsive design of the Results Project. I have included the FrontEnd Mentor 'provided' desktop & mobile jpg overviews of the project, along with my 'completed' screenshots of both versions.

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
I learned quite a bit from this project.  I intentionally left my comments in my code to review while I was working on the project, which I found very helpful.  My favorite concepts were setting up & utilizing the variables, learning which spacing unit to use relative to the parent/child, using attributes (eg. data-spacing), how to create background transparency, implementing variable fonts, and learning about gradients. I took the time to follow along with Kevin Powell's Results video and learn along the way. 


### Continued development
I'd like to continue working on learning responsive web development and nesting variables more effectively.


### Useful resources
- [Kevin Powell's Results Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8&t=1860s) - I followed along with this tutorial and adjusted as needed. I spent time separately researching and learning concepts within this project as well.
